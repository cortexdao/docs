# How to contribute

Hey! Thanks for checking out Cortex DAO - I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help build the future of decentralized finance.

If you haven't already, come find us in Discord (https://discord.gg/V4TF8C5Uke). You should find things that excite you there


## Contributing to development

Find an area you can help with and do it. Open source is about collaboration and open participation. Try to make your code look like what already exists and submit a pull request.
Work will take place in the respective repo for the part of the project you're contributing to. Each repo may also have it's own contribution guidelines and process.

## Finding places to contribute

The list of issues is a good place to start, especially the ones tagged as "help wanted". If you're looking for additional ideas, the code includes TODO comments for minor to major improvements. Use Search in files in your code editor, or grep "TODO" -r --exclude-dir=target --exclude-dir=.git ..
Additional tests and more documentation or updates/fixes to existing documentation is also very welcome.

## Submitting changes

We generally prefer you to PR your work earlier rather than later. This ensures everyone else has a better idea of what's being worked on, and can help reduce wasted effort. If work on your PR has just begun, please feel free to create the PR with [WIP] (work in progress) in the PR title, and let us know when it's ready for review in the comments.
Since mainnet has been released, the bar for having PRs accepted has been raised. Before submitting your PR for approval, please be ensure it:
Includes a proper description of what problems the PR addresses, as well as a detailed explanation as to what it changes
Explains whether/how the change is consensus breaking or breaks existing client functionality
Contains unit tests exercising new/changed functionality
Fully considers the potential impact of the change on other parts of the system
Describes how you've tested the change (e.g. against Testnet, etc)
Updates any documentation that's affected by the PR
If submitting a PR consisting of documentation changes only, please try to ensure that the change is significantly more substantial than one or two lines. For example, working through an install document and making changes and updates throughout as you find issues is worth a PR. For typos and other small changes, either contact one of the developers, or if you think it's a significant enough error to cause problems for other users, please feel free to open an issue.
The development team will be happy to help and guide you with any of these points and work with you getting your PR submitted for approval. Create a PR with [WIP] in the title and ask for specific assistance within the issue, or contact the dev team on any of the channels below.
