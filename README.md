# Welcome to the Cortex DAO 

The purpose of the Cortex DAO is to support the community led development and management of a decentralized finance platform.

## How the DAO Operates

The Cortex DAO will receive operating income from the Cortex protocol, with a portion of the yield earned going into the treasury. The treasury will fund the development (expansion) and day to day operation (maintenance) of the protocol. 

DAO members can signal a desire to make changes to the protocol via governance voting.
